         <p>I am a film major with a great interest in History. 
             I am considering a minor or even major in History.
         </p> My favorite hobby is lego collection and stop motion.

            My home church is Fall Creek Baptist Church located in Jonesville NC,

             I have five sibilings and the best mom and dad in the world.
            The thing I love most is spending time with my family. 
             I can't wait for Thanksgiving break!
